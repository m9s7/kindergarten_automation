def download_file_as_bytes(service, file_id):
    """
    Downloads the content of a file from Google Drive using the Google Drive API, and returns the content as a BytesIO object.

    Parameters:
    - service: The Google Drive API service object, obtained through authentication.
    - file_id: The unique identifier for the file to download.

    Returns:
    - A BytesIO object containing the file content.

    Example usage:
    ```
    # Authenticate and create a Google Drive API service object
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)

    # Call the download_file_as_bytes() function to download a file as bytes
    file_content = download_file_as_bytes(service, 'abc123')

    # Convert the BytesIO object to a binary file and save it
    with open('downloaded_file.pdf', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(file_content.getbuffer())
    ```

    Notes:
    - This function uses the `files().get_media()` method of the Google Drive API to download the file content.
    - The function returns the file content as a BytesIO object, which must be converted to an appropriate file format before it can be saved or manipulated as a file.
    """
    request = service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)
    file_content = io.BytesIO(request.execute())

    return file_content

# To download Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files, use files.export instead of files.get_media.
# This is because these file types are not stored as traditional files in Google Drive, but rather as
# documents within the Google ecosystem. Exporting the file to a supported format (e.g. PDF, DOCX)
# ensures that you can download and manipulate the file contents. To export a file, you will need to
# set the mimeType parameter to the desired output format. For example, to export a Google Doc file
# as a PDF, you would use mimeType='application/pdf' when calling the files().export() method.
